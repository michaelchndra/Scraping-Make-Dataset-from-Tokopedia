# **Scrape & Make Dataset from Website Tokopedia**

This is an automated method of web scraping, which functions to scrape or take data from the Tokopedia website and then make it into a dataframe. I made this for the needs of my learning project, namely creating an E-commerce AI Chatbot.

This scrape method uses the Python language with some help from the Python's library:
- **Selenium** to automation scraping process
- **Beautiful Soup** to scrape or collect data from websites, and
- **Pandas** to transform the data into a dataframe, then save to a csv file.

## **Web scraping result**
Here is the list of column name and definition in `dataset-tokopedia.csv` file:

  |Column Name|Definition                                         |                          
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
|Img    |Image of the product                                   |
|Name     |Name of the product                                |
|Price      |Price of the product (in IDR)                      |
